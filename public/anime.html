        A virtual reality gaming console known as the "NerveGear" is released to
        the public alongside the world's first virtual reality game called "Sword
        Art Online" (SAO). A beta-tester named Kirito logs in and visits Aincrad,
        the setting where the game takes place, and quickly befriends a fellow
        novice player named Klein, to whom he teaches the basics of the game,
        including how to defeat a boar. A few hours later, Kirito and Klein
        discover that they cannot log out. Akihiko Kayaba, the game's creator and
        employee of the computer corporation Argus, announces to the players that
        he intentionally removed the option to log out and that players will die
        if either their NerveGear helmet is forcefully removed or their in-game
        health bar is depleted to zero. He also admits that he created this game
        as a way to become God over his own dominion, and that the only way to
        log out of the game is to clear all of Aincrad's 100 Floors.

        Two months later, Kazuto Kirigaya aka Kazuto Narusaka and his adoptive
        sister Suguha Kirigaya have a kendo match, but he loses due to his sword
        stance and fighting style being ineffective outside the virtual reality
        environment. Kazuto goes to the hospital to visit Asuna Yuuki, who has
        yet to wake up from her coma, along with 300 other players. Kazuto meets
        Asuna's father Shōzō Yuuki, CEO of computer corporation RECT Progress
        Inc., and his associate Nobuyuki Sugō, who intends to marry Asuna while
        she is in her comatose state, much to Kazuto's fury. Later at home,
        Kazuto breaks down before Suguha, who comforts him. Suguha recalls
        her mother Midori Kirigaya saying that Kazuto is actually her cousin
        and harbors her own feelings for him. The next morning, Kazuto receives
        an e-mail from Andrew Gilbert Mills with a screenshot from another game
        of an avatar that resembles "Asuna".

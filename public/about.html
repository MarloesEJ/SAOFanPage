      <p>Sword Art Online (ソードアート・オンライン, Sōdo Āto Onrain?, abbreviated
        as SAO) is the first ever VRMMORPG produced by Argus for the NerveGear,
        with Kayaba Akihiko as the development director. The online game takes
        place on a hundred-floor floating castle called Aincrad.</p>

        <p>Prior to official launch, Sword Art Online Closed Beta was available
           to 1,000 beta testers for a one month period from August to September
           2022. During that period, Sword Art Online was lauded as an
           incredible experience, and it received extremely positive reviews
           despite the actual difficulty of the game. After the Closed Beta
           Testing ended, the Beta Testers were given the opportunity to pre-order
           the game.</p>
        <p>Only 10,000 copies were printed in the first batch of the game, and
           online sales sold out within seconds. Hard-core gamers waited in line
           for days to purchase the first few hard copies from many stores.</p>
        <p>Sword Art Online officially started server service at 13:00 on
           November 6, 2022 and obtained infamy when the creator succeeded in
           trapping 10,000 people in the game, and making it so that death in-game
           would mean actual death for the player. During the two-year period
           the game remained active, Sword Art Online evolved into an innovative
           yet complex society of individuals with mixed feelings about the
           possibility of clearing the game.</p>

          </table>
           <p>The game operates similar to most MMORPGs with a level system and
             eventual skill mastery with some limits placed on it. The entire
             game is monitored and maintained by the Cardinal System, which
             self-corrects any problems.</p>
          <p>While the Sword Art Online mainframe is capable of incredible
            graphical and rendering capacities, it does not actually render the
            entire environment in full detail unless a certain region is
            specifically observed by a player. SAO uses a Digital Focusing System,
             which brings out the finer details of an object only when a player
             shows interest and focuses their visual field on it. This reduces
             the strain on the SAO mainframe processor, which, despite its high
             performance power, is incapable of rendering all marginal details
             of the environment simultaneously. This effectually produces the
             illusion that the SAO graphical and VR experience is incredibly
             detailed. However, the SAO mainframe has a difficult time rendering
             the sensation of water in baths or showers.</p>

        </table>
        <p>As a complete virtual reality MMORPG, the SAO system is capable of
          rendering the entire Aincrad environment with incredible realism. By
          stimulating nerves in the brain, it is possible to taste food, feel the
          wind and weather, move one's body, and live in SAO as if it were an
          lternate reality. However, there are several major differences that
          set the Sword Art Online environment apart from the real-world experience.</p>
        <p>First, no pain is actually felt in any situation. As a result, players
          can undergo severe injuries and still only feel an uncomfortable
          tingling sensation. Second, there is no blood; in its place are red
          virtual gashes that are seen in the place of injuries. Third, Sword
          Skills allow attacks to be performed with normally impossible speed,
          dexterity, and power, based on the player's stats. Fourth, there
          are some everyday actions that simply are not done in the SAO world,
          such as changing clothes by hand or attempting to wield two items
          at the same time.</p>
        <p>While playing Sword Art Online, players still feel fatigue and hunger,
           regardless of the state of their actual bodies. As a result it is an
           absolute necessity for all players to eat and sleep within the game;
           however there is never a need to go to the bathroom.</p>
        <p>Death or deletion in the game is visualized by fragmentation into
          thousands of polygon shards. All monsters, items, and players that have
           their HP or durability reduced to zero, disappear and fragment into
           polygons in such a fashion.</p>
